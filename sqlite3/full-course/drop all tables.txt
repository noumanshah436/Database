To clean up a SQLite database by removing all objects and data, you can use the following steps:

### Option 1: Drop Tables

You can drop all tables in the database using the `DROP TABLE` statement. However, this approach assumes that you only have tables and no other objects like views, triggers, etc.

```sql
PRAGMA foreign_keys=off;

BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Drop all tables
SELECT 'DROP TABLE ' || name || ';' FROM sqlite_master WHERE type = 'table';

-- Execute the generated statements

COMMIT;
PRAGMA foreign_keys=on;
```

Replace `'DROP TABLE ' || name || ';'` with `'DROP VIEW ' || name || ';'` if you have views to drop as well.

### Option 2: Delete All Rows

If you want to keep the tables but remove all data, you can use the `DELETE` statement:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Delete all data from tables
DELETE FROM table1;
DELETE FROM table2;
-- Repeat for all tables

COMMIT;
```

### Option 3: Drop and Recreate Database

If you want to remove everything, including the database itself, you can simply delete the database file and recreate it. Be careful with this method, as it will permanently delete the entire database.

```bash
-- Assuming you're in a Unix-like environment
rm your_database_name.db
sqlite3 your_database_name.db
```

Replace `your_database_name.db` with the actual name of your SQLite database file.

Choose the option that best fits your needs, considering whether you want to keep the structure (tables, views, etc.) or just remove the data. Always make sure to back up your database before performing any major operations to avoid accidental data loss.
