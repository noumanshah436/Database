Use the following tables to write the queries
EMP (empno, ename, job, sal, hiredate, mgr, comm, deptno)
DEPT (deptno, dname, loc)
List all the CLERKs having single S in their names.
select * from emp where ename like '%S%'
Display the department wise of count of employees of all the departments.
select count(*) from emp group by deptno
Suppose that the name of each employees stored in the field "ename" consists of "first name" and "last name". Write a query to display the ename in two columns, "Fname" and "Lname". For example, ename="Asif Sohail" should be displayed as Fname = "Asif" and Lname = "Sohail".
select   substr(ename ,1,instr(ename,' ')),substr(ename ,instr(ename,' ')) from emp
Find the name of the department with the highest number of employees.
select deptno,max(count(*))  from emp
List all employees with more than 10 years of service.
select *   from emp where  months_between(SYSDATE, hire_date)*12 >10
Display empno, ename, job, deptno, danme. The output should display all the matching as well as non-matching instances.
select * from emp, dept
